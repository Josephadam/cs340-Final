<h2>Reflection: MongoDB Dashboard Project</h2>

<h3>1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</h3>
<p>
To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I focused on keeping my code modular and well-documented. In Project One, I built a CRUD Python module that separated database logic from the dashboard UI. This helped reduce repetition and made it easy to troubleshoot or enhance individual operations like insert, update, delete, and read without affecting the entire system. When I moved on to Project Two, I was able to connect the Dash dashboard widgets to the same CRUD module with minimal changes. The advantage of this approach is that I can now reuse the CRUD module in future dashboards or expand it to include additional queries and aggregation pipelines. It promotes scalability and reduces the amount of rework needed in similar MongoDB projects.

<h3>2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?</h3>
<p>
I approach problems by first understanding the requirements and breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks. For Grazioso Salvare, I began by analyzing the database structure and how it matched the dashboard’s data display needs. I sketched out how filters would interact with MongoDB queries and ensured that the results aligned with the user’s goals—like sorting rescue animals by mission type or location. Compared to previous assignments, this project required more real-world thinking and problem-solving because it mimicked working with a client. In the future, I would continue using this structured approach: understand the data, define goals, modularize logic, and test often to make sure the system is flexible enough to meet evolving client needs.

<h3>3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?</h3>
<p>
Computer scientists solve problems by creating technology-driven solutions that improve efficiency, automation, and decision-making. In this project, my work helps a company like Grazioso Salvare better analyze and manage its rescue operations through a live data dashboard. By filtering and visualizing mission-critical data, they can make faster, more informed decisions about animal placement and readiness for rescue scenarios. This kind of solution matters because it bridges raw data with actionable insights—something every modern business relies on to stay competitive and mission-focused.
